## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am deeply interested in **software engineering as a discipline**, not restricted to one technology or domain.  
I enjoy learning how different systems work — from frontend interfaces to backend services, databases, infrastructure, and architecture.

I actively explore **multiple domains** because I enjoy understanding technology **beyond boundaries**, pushing my learning capacity beyond what is required.

## 🧠 Engineering Areas I’m Learning
## 🧠 Engineering Areas I’m Learning

- ⚙️ **System Design**  
  Designing scalable systems by understanding API design, database selection, caching strategies, load handling, consistency models, and trade-offs between performance, cost, and reliability.

- 📊 **DSA with Java**  
  Strengthening problem-solving ability through data structures and algorithms, focusing on logic building, time–space complexity analysis, and writing efficient, readable solutions.

- 🧩 **Software Engineering Principles**  
  Writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code using principles such as SOLID, DRY, separation of concerns, abstraction, and modular design.

- 🏗 **Architecture Patterns**  
  Studying MVC, layered architecture, and modular backend design to build systems that are scalable, testable, and easy to maintain.

- 🔌 **API Design & Backend Contracts**  
  Designing clear and consistent APIs, understanding request–response lifecycles, versioning, error handling, and data validation.

- 🔐 **Security Fundamentals**  
  Learning authentication and authorization concepts, secure API practices, token-based access (JWT), input validation, and common security pitfalls.

- ⚡ **Performance & Optimization**  
  Understanding performance bottlenecks, efficient database queries, indexing, caching basics, and backend optimization techniques.

- 🧪 **Testing & Debugging**  
  Learning how to test backend logic, debug production issues, handle edge cases, and write code that is easier to verify and maintain.

- ☁️ **Deployment & Infrastructure Basics**  
  Exploring how applications are deployed, environment configuration, container basics, CI/CD concepts, and infrastructure awareness.

- 📐 **Code Quality & Maintainability**  
  Focusing on readable code, meaningful naming, consistent structure, and long-term maintainability rather than short-term solutions.

  Utility-first styling, responsive layouts, consistent UI design, and clean component styling.

---

### ⚙️ Backend

- **Node.js**  
  Event-driven backend development, handling concurrent requests, and building scalable server-side applications.

- **Express.js**  
  REST API development, middleware architecture, routing, error handling, and request lifecycle management.

- **RESTful APIs**  
  Designing structured endpoints, HTTP methods, status codes, request/response patterns, and API consistency.

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  User authentication flows, token-based security (JWT), role-based access control, and protected routes.

---

### 🗄 Database

- **MongoDB**  
  NoSQL database usage, document-based storage, and performance-aware querying.

- **Schema Design & Data Modeling**  
  Designing schemas, relationships, indexing strategies, and structuring data for scalability and clarity.

---
