👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in software engineering as a discipline, not just a single stack.
I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end — from frontend interfaces to backend services, databases, and architecture.

🧠 What I’m Learning

System Design – APIs, scalability, caching, and architectural trade-offs

Data Structures & Algorithms (Java) – Logic building and complexity analysis

Backend Engineering – REST APIs, validation, error handling, and security

Software Engineering Principles – Clean code, SOLID, modular design

Performance & Optimization – Database queries, indexing, basic caching

Deployment Basics – Docker, CI/CD concepts, environment configuration

💻 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication
Database: MongoDB (schema design & indexing)
Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, Linux, Docker (basics)

📌 Projects

Spotify Clone – Frontend architecture & UI flows

Video Platform – Backend APIs & content handling

NextGen AI – AI-integrated web application

Portfolio Website – Technical self-presentation
