👨‍💻 About Me

I am deeply interested in software engineering as a discipline, not limited to a single technology or domain.
I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end — from frontend interfaces to backend services, databases, and application architecture.

I actively explore multiple areas of computer science to build a strong foundation and understand technology beyond surface-level implementation.

🧠 Engineering Areas I’m Learning

⚙️ System Design
Learning how scalable systems are designed by studying APIs, database choices, caching strategies, and trade-offs between performance, reliability, and cost.

📊 Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)
Strengthening problem-solving skills through structured DSA practice, with focus on logic building, time–space complexity, and clean implementations.

🧩 Software Engineering Principles
Writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code using SOLID principles, abstraction, separation of concerns, and modular design.

🏗 Architecture Patterns
Exploring MVC, layered architecture, and modular backend patterns to build scalable, testable, and maintainable systems.

🔌 API Design & Backend Development
Designing RESTful APIs with proper request–response handling, validation, error management, and consistent contracts.

🔐 Security Fundamentals
Understanding authentication and authorization, JWT-based access control, secure API practices, and common backend security issues.

⚡ Performance & Optimization
Learning about performance bottlenecks, database query optimization, indexing strategies, and basic caching techniques.

🧪 Testing & Debugging
Improving debugging skills, handling edge cases, and writing code that is easier to test and maintain.

☁️ Deployment & Infrastructure Basics
Gaining awareness of application deployment, environment configuration, CI/CD concepts, containers, and infrastructure fundamentals.

📐 Code Quality & Maintainability
Focusing on readable code, meaningful naming, consistent structure, and long-term maintainability over quick solutions.
