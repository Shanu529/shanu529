## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am deeply interested in **software engineering as a discipline**, not restricted to one technology or domain.  
I enjoy learning how different systems work — from frontend interfaces to backend services, databases, infrastructure, and architecture.

I actively explore **multiple domains** because I enjoy understanding technology **beyond boundaries**, pushing my learning capacity beyond what is required.
